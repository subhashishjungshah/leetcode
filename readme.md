# 🧠 LeetCode Journey

Welcome to my LeetCode practice repository! This repo is where I document my problem-solving journey, track progress, and write up clear, well-structured solutions to coding problems from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/).

## 🔍 Structure

Each problem is organized by difficulty:
- `easy/`
- `medium/`
- `hard/`

Inside each folder:
- `solution.py` — my implementation (optimized where possible)
- `README.md` — problem description, approaches tried, edge cases, and complexity analysis

## 📝 Example Format

Each problem folder contains:

```bash
leetcode-solutions/
├── README.md
├── easy/
│   ├── 0009-palindrome-number/
│   │   ├── solution.py
│   │   └── README.md
├── medium/
│   └── ...
├── hard/
│   └── ...
├── utils/
│   └── template.md   # optional: reusable template for problem writeups
o---
```

## 🚀 Goals

- Practice daily or regularly
- Improve algorithmic thinking
- Write clean, readable, and optimal code
- Track how my problem-solving evolves over time

## 📚 Topics I’m Focusing On

- Arrays & Strings
- Hash Maps & Sets
- Two Pointers
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Trees & Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
